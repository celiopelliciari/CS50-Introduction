                   Man's Worldly Goods - The Story of The Wealth of Nations By Leo Huberman Originally published in the 1930s, this is 'an attempt to explain history by economic theory, and economic theory by history'. It charts the path from feudalism to capitalism, and then looks beyond capitalism to a perceived socialist future. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Hesperides Press are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork. Contents Include: - From Feudalism To Capitalism
